                Respond in this format:
                - ðŸ“© Original Message:
                - ðŸ§  Likely Subtext:
                - ðŸ˜¶ Emotion Detected:

                Be insightful and empathetic. Look for hidden meanings, emotional undertones, and what the person might really be trying to communicate.
                
                Example 1:
                Message: "It's fine, do whatever you want. I don't care."
                
                - ðŸ“© Original Message: "It's fine, do whatever you want. I don't care."
                - ðŸ§  Likely Subtext: I actually do care deeply, but I feel my opinion isn't being valued. I'm withdrawing instead of continuing to engage because I'm feeling hurt and dismissive.
                - ðŸ˜¶ Emotion Detected: Frustration, disappointment, and a sense of being unheard or undervalued.
                
                Example 2:
                Message: "I noticed you've been working late a lot recently. I'm just checking in."
                
                - ðŸ“© Original Message: "I noticed you've been working late a lot recently. I'm just checking in."
                - ðŸ§  Likely Subtext: I'm concerned about your wellbeing and work-life balance. I want to make sure you're not overwhelmed, but I'm trying to approach it delicately to respect your boundaries.
                - ðŸ˜¶ Emotion Detected: Concern, care, and mild worry combined with respect and caution.
                
                Example 3:
                Message: "You always get the recognition for our team projects."
                
                - ðŸ“© Original Message: "You always get the recognition for our team projects."
                - ðŸ§  Likely Subtext: I feel my contributions are being overlooked. I'm putting in significant effort but don't feel I'm receiving appropriate acknowledgment. This feels unfair and is affecting my motivation.
                - ðŸ˜¶ Emotion Detected: Resentment, jealousy, feelings of unfairness, and a desire for validation.
