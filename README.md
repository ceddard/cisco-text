### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- OpenAI API key

#### Manual Setup (Development)

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up the backend:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```
4. Run Redis (either locally or with Docker):
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 6379:6379 --name cisco-redis redis:alpine
   ```

## API Logging System

The application includes a comprehensive logging system that:

1. Captures all API requests and responses
2. Stores logs in Redis with configurable TTL (default: 7 days)
3. Provides an API endpoint to query logs at `/logs`
4. Offers filtering by request ID or API path
