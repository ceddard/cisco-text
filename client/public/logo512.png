You need to create a 512x512 pixel PNG image file for the logo.

You can create a simple placeholder by:
1. Using a graphics tool like Paint, Photoshop, or GIMP
2. Create a new image with dimensions 512x512 pixels
3. Fill it with a color (preferably matching your app theme)
4. Add text or simple icon if desired
5. Save as PNG with the name "logo512.png" in the client/public directory
